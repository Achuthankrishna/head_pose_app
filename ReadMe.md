    git clone https://github.com/Achuthankrishna/head_pose_app
    ```
    Get into the folder
    ```bash
        cd head_pose_app

   ```bash
   docker -v
   ```
   to check your docker version. Once done , execute the command below to build the container: 
   ```bash
   sudo docker build -t head_pose_app .
   ```

3. **Start the Container**
   To start the streamlit web application, run:
   ```bash
   sudo docker run -privileged -v /dev/video0:/dev/video0 -p 8501:85001 head_pose_app
   ```
   This command then map the port 8501 of the container to port 8501 on your host machine.

4. **Click the link on the terminal**
